------------

The following section list a number of example plugins for earthquake, tsunami and flood. They demonstrate a number of the different ways that plugins might be developed including a demonstration of styling, accessing layer metadata and conditional impact calculation based on the metadata.

.. warning:: This plugin code in these examples is provided for example and tutorial purposes only. They are not guarenteed to produce the valid impact results under all situations and may rely on a number of (unstated) assumptions about the underlying data. In other words you milage may vary.
