The keywords system
===================


Each layer must have keywords that tell the impact calculator what it is.
An full example of keywords file is

category: exposure
subcategory: population
title: Population density Yogyakarta
datatype: population density
linked: female_pct_yogya.tif,poor_pct_yogya.tif
density: yes

Note, that it is currently not possible to have a space between the linked layers!
