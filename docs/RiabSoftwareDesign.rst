Introduction
============

This document is a software design specification of the ?Risk in a Box?
solution or Riab`[1]`_ for short. It is intended as a reference document for
the software architecture to inform and guide developers about the
architecture, standards, coding conventions, use cases and design constrains.

Good risk analyses rely on modelling using spatial information ranging from
geophysical data to population information and administrative jurisdictions.
The purpose tool is to support the implementation of risk assessment
guidelines by:

1.  Making them easy to use
2.  Allowing results to be reproduced
3.  Ensuring consistency across different reporting authorities

In support of these aims risk in the box will:

1.  Be able to be run across a variety of common platforms
2.  Run both locally without Internet access and remotely
3.  Use commonly available standards and technologies
4.  Support interfaces to a variety of external systems (e.g. GeoNode)
5.  Support flexible development of impact models using plugins
6.  Be internationalized

Basic system requirements to use Risk in a Box are GeoNode, Apache, Python,
Django, Open Layers. This includes having a Java Runtime Environment
installed.

A document describing the aims of the risk in a box project in more detail is
provided at `Risk in a Box - Project Plan`_


System Overview
===============

Riab in essence provides a way that scientific data in the form of spatial
hazard estimates from tsunami, earthquake, volcanic ash, storms etc. can be
combined with exposure data such as population or infrastructure to provide
end users such as disaster managers with a geographic risk/impact estimation.
This will ultimately allow the construction of an actionable risk management
plan.

To this end the system must be able to take a variety of geographic data
layers (in either vector or raster) from a GeoNode and intelligently work out
what impact function will be ?appropriate for a given hazard and exposure.
These impact functions will be written as plugins and will allow experts to
construct new techniques for an impact calculation of the form

Impact = Risk_Plugin(Hazard, Exposure)

The hazard and exposure types will be determined from the meta data stored
with the GeoNode layer and this is used to choose the correct plugin.

For flexibility and maintainability the software is split into two major
subsystems which will communicate using XML-RPC.

1.  Riab-Engine: The central server that will calculate the impact
    function using plugins and data fetched from the GeoServers. It is
    expected to run standalone and have a dependency in Celery. With code
    based on the djcelery package (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-celery)
2.  Riab-Client: The web based front-end allowing both a simplified end-
    user front end and a more advanced administration mode.

Design Considerations
---------------------

This section describes the design issues and considerations that are being
addressed during the full design process.


Assumptions and Dependencies
----------------------------

Primary dependencies exist with the GeoServer REST interface and the Django
Version.

Django was chosen as the web framework as it is synergic with other relevant
project and has an active development community.

Python 2.7x is being used to develop this project (both for Django and
Server) as it provides good flexibility for this type of system design.
Version 3.x of python has been released, and will eventually supersede the
2.x series however support for 3.x in third party libraries is currently
still low so the risk of software issues in using python versions >2 judged
to be higher as of Jan 2011.

The Riab solution will be implemented in phases. See Riab Projec Plan for
details.

The verson 1.0 assumptions are included below:

1.  Riab will need to be able to run on a local disconnected PC via a USB
    interface.
2.  Centralized server installation must also be supported
3.  Windows and Linux (developed using Ubuntu >= 10.4) will need to be supported

**End-user characteristics : Risk Managers**

1.  Risk Managers will not be expert in hazard modelling
2.  Will use the system through a web browser
3.  Interface must be simple and support full language
    internationalization.
4.  Input should allow local users to upload geo-data from spreadsheets
    about local conditions.
5.  Output should be clear and understandable.
6.  An expert advanced user mode should be supported for more experienced
    users.

**End-user characteristics: Advanced Modellers**

1.  Must be able to upload maps layers and set layer metadata
2.  Should be able to use the plugin API to define new risk/impact
    functions

**End-user characteristics: Administrators**

1.  Should be able to setup users permissions
2.  Review an audit of activities
3.  Update local documentation

**Possible and/or probable changes in functionality**

1.  Support for more complex impact models
2.  Output should lead to a full risk management plan
3.  Increase support for probabilistic modeling (on a hazard by hazard
    basis)
4.  Interface with other Risk based web frameworks and with science based
    hazard estimation tools.


General Constraints
-------------------

Describe any global limitations or constraints that have a significant impact
on the design of the system's software (and describe the associated impact).
Such constraints may be imposed by any of the following:

* Hardware or software environment

* Limitation of no network cases or low spec?ed machines

* End-user environment

* Standards compliance

 +  Should conform with international standards including WMS `http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms)`_

* Interoperability requirements

 + OGC compliant protocols (as above)

* Interface/protocol requirements

 +  Must be able to be completely distributed (i.e. remote geoservers) or completely local (everything running on one PC)

*  Data repository and distribution requirements

*  Security requirements (or other such regulations)

 +  The system should not hold user sensitive data

 +  Consideration should be given to OpenID as a standard for authentication.

*  Memory and other capacity limitations

 + Restrictions may exist for the system when installed on a USB Stick

*  Performance requirements

  +  Peak transaction volume even when centralizated will be relatively low (less than 1 request per second)

*  Verification and validation requirements (testing)

 +  All builds should have a full test suite used


Goals and Guidelines
--------------------

Principles which embody the design of software include:

1.  Modularity and functional separation. Ensuring that API level
    separation (via web services) is maintained between the functional
    components (Server, Web frontend and GeoServer)
2.  Emphasis on maintainability and robustness versus speed. Since this
    will be an open source project it is desired to make the code simple and
    well documented.
3.  Ability to play well with other relevant frameworks. The Riab system
    will need to integrate with other Risk based web frameworks and with
    science based hazard estimation tools e.g. OpenQuake, BNPB DIPI,
    Bakosurtanal SIGN project etc.





Architectural Strategies
========================

The Riab_app is designed to be stateless. This provides both greater
flexibility and robustness as it allows for easier scaling and for more
comprehensive testing. The impact of this is a slight performance hit since
reconnections (and re: authentication) to GeoServers need to be done for each
transaction.

All user settings and user interface will be managed through the Django
framework application. The GeoServer rendering will be done using OpenLayers
(http://openlayers.org/) and other associated javascript GeoExt, GXP. Where
practical ?functions will be exposed as Ajax calls.

The web interface is yet to be documented.


System Architecture
===================

This section provides a high-level overview of how the functionality and
responsibilities are partitioned and then assigned to subsystems and
components. The various architectural components of Riab and the protocols
used are described below (see .)[NOTE: GeoServer and pyplugin have been left
out for the moment until we are sure about the overall structure.]

Figure 2: High Level Architecture Components

Riab Core (riab_core): This module is responsible for calculating the impact
function. It uses file like objects (e.g. geotiff and gml) and associated
metadata to determine which risk plug-in to call. It then calls this plugin
and writes the resulting layer to file and returns the fully qualified
pathname. Riab Core makes the following assumptions:

1.  Input layer files are either geotiff (for raster data) or gml (for
    vector data)
2.  All layers are in WGS84 geographic coordinates
3.  Layers are named (either as dictionaries or using the internal naming
    structure of geotiff and gml)

Risk Plugins: These are plugins written in python that allow customized
impact functions to be run depending on the type of hazard and the exposure.
There may be none, one or many plugins that will satisfy a particular
combination of hazard and exposure. Each plugin makes the following
assumptions

1.  Input data are dictionaries of numerical (numpy) arrays where keys
    are the original layer names.
2.  Data points have been aligned so vector operations are allowed.
3.  It is up to the plugin to know the semantics of names and attributes,
    i.e. if there is a layer named WALL_TYPE with attributes like Fibro,
    Timber, Brick veneer etc, the plugin must be aware of the meaning of
    these names and used them correctly.

PyPlugin: A flexible python library to manage the plugins, find the
appropriate plugin for a given criteria and execute this.

Riab Server (riab_server): This is the central stateless server that exposes
the API for riab_core via XML-RPC.

Riab Web Server (riab_django): The web based front-end allowing both a
simplified, advanced and administration user types. Riab-django is
responsible for retrieving and storing layers on one or more GeoNode and for
passing the associated files on to riab_server for computation. The web
client can query the Riab-Server to find out what plugins are available and
request an impact calculation based on one or more layers hazard and one or
more exposure layers. The administration of users and other local settings
are managed by Django. In particular it will

1.  Allow the user to select layers for hazard levels and exposure data
2.  Get layers from GeoNodes by bounding box and in WGS84 geographical
    coordinates irrespective of the native projection or datum and provide
    them to riab_server as geotiff (for rasters) or gml (for vector data).
3.  Put resulting layers back to a GeoNode and provide a view of them
4.  Provide legends for all layers
5.  ?..

Riab Web Interface: Rendered using Django Templates and OpenLayers . The
interface talks to both the Riap-Django and the relavent GeoServers.


Component Communications
========================

The flow of information between subsystems is shown below (). ?Note that this
diagram includes a full test case including the initial upload of data into
Geoserver. This will not be required for risk managers. The bold items show
steps that are either input or output for the user.
